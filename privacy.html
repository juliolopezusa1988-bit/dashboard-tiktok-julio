    <p><em>Last updated: September 14, 2025</em></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Dashboard TikTok Julio</strong> application (“the App”) handles your information.</p>

        <li>Basic account information necessary to establish the connection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Use of information</h2>
    <p>Data is used solely for personal analysis, reporting, and content optimization. The App does not use the data for advertising, profiling, or resale.</p>

    <h2>3. Data sharing</h2>
    <p>The App does not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties. Data is not disclosed except as required by law or with your explicit direction.</p>

    <h2>4. Data storage and security</h2>
    <p>Data retrieved via the API is stored locally or in your own secure environment. Reasonable technical and organizational measures are applied to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or loss.</p>

    <h2>5. User control</h2>
    <p>You can revoke the App’s access to your TikTok account at any time through TikTok’s account settings. If you disconnect access, the App will no longer retrieve new data.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the App after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
